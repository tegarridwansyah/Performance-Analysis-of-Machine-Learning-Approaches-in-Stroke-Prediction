# Performance-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Approaches-in-Stroke-Prediction
This is a dummy project as an exercise in analyzing the performance of machine learning models. The process is referenced to a paper. There are differences in the process used, I added oversampling techniques to handle the problem of unbalanced datasets. The results obtained also increased from the initial 97% accuracy to **99%**.
